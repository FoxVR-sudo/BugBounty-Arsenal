"""Cloudflare JS challenge solver using Playwright.

This module launches a temporary headless Chromium instance via Playwright
to solve Cloudflare "Just a moment" style challenges. The solver collects
resulting cookies (e.g. cf_clearance) and returns them so the aiohttp
session can reuse the authenticated context.
